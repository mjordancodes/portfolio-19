This talk came after [Sarah Joy](https://twitter.com/superissarah) gave an awesome talk on the [History of CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSJQHyU15AjJ9fIGyX5u-U_wkH6w3oaM73q8jrY2hJa90UfUndXCthN-V0L7_yJzSjNRbRmPwf4lHCX/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000#slide=id.p). Following my talk, we presented an [unstyled HTML timeline on CodePen](https://codepen.io/mjordancodes/details/OqPwgN) with internet history for all the attendees to style in their own way. The timeline was meant as a [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) type lab.

This is [my version](https://codepen.io/mjordancodes/pen/moyvYg) of the timeline with some styling. You can see other things people made by looking at the forked pens from the [original post.](https://codepen.io/mjordancodes/details/OqPwgN)
