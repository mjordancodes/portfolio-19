# Puppies-and-Portfolio-members

Have you been to one or more Puppies and Portfolio Hangout Club Thing?
Add your self (and your portfolio) to the list: 

- Create a new markdown file in this folder
- Add the following frontmatter and include any information you want:
```
---
layout: member
name: ''
role: ''
portfolioURL: ''
portfolio: ''
githubURL: ''
github: ''
twitterURL: ''
twitter: ''
---
```

Note: please leave the first line `layout: member` as is. I use it to get the right content for the correct page
