  I have once again started to rebuild my portfolio site. The logic (excuse)
  this time is that I have a fancy new name so I need a fancy new site to go
  with it. Part of the new name comes from my switch to using my middle name
  instead of my first name (see blog for the long story) and part of the new
  name comes from getting married (a thing I did last week).


  I am building my portfolio in Gatsby because it is awesome. I am also using
  Netlify for deployment/hosting and NetlifyCMS for content. I've also put a big
  focus on creating my own illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and animating them
  with a combination of CSS Animations and Greensock. It has been a lot of fun
  to combine all of these different technologies and figuring out how to make
  them play nicely. I may have to write a blog post (or two) about the process
  once I finish.

The first group I co-taught is just starting project week at the end of the sections I teach. It is super cool to see how much they have learnt in such a short period of time. I'll be spending the next few weeks deeply focused on what I want to teach to the next group which I get at the end of January.
