              Iâ€™m Jordan, a creative front end developer currently teaching as lead instructor at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, Oregon. Nothing excites me more than immersing myself in a good challenge or a great book. For me, coding is the perfect mix of logical problem solving, and creative artistic expression. When not coding, I am spending my time creating something new, getting involved in the local tech community, or exploring the world around me with my trusty Nikon camera.

              During summer of 2015 I attended my first tech event: an event put on by Women Who Code Portland that introduced me to the wonderful world of meetups. Since then, I have continued attending numerous different meetups where I learnt a lot, met some amazing humans, and grew well out of my comfort zone.

            <p>
              Today, I volunteer as part of the Leadership Teams for PDXNode and Women Who Code Portland. I also mentor periodically at other local meetups such as Free Code Camp Portland and Mentorship Saturdays.

              During the second half of 2016 I moved from an occasional volunteer to a full member of the leadership team. In the beginning, I mostly helped out with monthly networking nights. I was even able to take lead and plan one myself. in 2018, I stepped up into a more regular role as the co-lead for the new monthly Open Soruce Study Nights. As co-lead for a study night, I schedule speakers, prepare my own content to teach, and generally answer questions for people who attend the events.
