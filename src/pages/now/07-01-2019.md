  I am updating my portfolio to have more consistant code by using ESLint and Prettier. I am also rebuilding my components in a more logical way and documenting them in Storybook. Since I've spent a lot of time working on prototyping, I hadn't spent enough time learning about the tooling for JavaScript projects, so it is a big focus right now.

- While job hunting, I have been doing a few freelance projects. Most of them have been converting WordPress Sites into Gatsby sites. It has been a lot of fun and I am learning more about Gatsby every day. 

- I am also building a fun React/Redux project that will have a full database / backend to manage the books I have and read. It is a work in progress, but the code can be found on [github](https://github.com/mjordancodes/Jordan-s-Library).

- Over the weekend I spoke at [Indie Web Summit](https://indieweb.org/2019) as a keynote speaker. I had a chance to share my story about why I changed my name. The recording should be up soon.
