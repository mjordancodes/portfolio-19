It seems like it is that time of year to reflect on the past twelve months. 

So what have I been up to this year? The biggest thing is probably that whole [I got married](http://michelleandzack.love/) thing. The most fun thing was definitely getting my two little puppies, [Cub and Pebbles](https://www.instagram.com/cubandpebbles/). We moved out from the place we had been living for the past two years, and are now roommate free again. 

I went to a bunch of tech conferences. I organized an [International NodeBots day in Portland](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/252277861/), as well as an in-person version of the [Free Code Camp Online JAMStack Hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/Free-Code-Camp-Portland/events/255620024/). I also continued to act as organizer for PDXNode and helped with a bunch of events. I set up a lightning talk night that was very well recieved and a special presentation night as part of OSCON. 

I spent most of the year working as a contractor at Nike. I spent most of my time there as part of the "garage team" as a prototyper. I really enjoyed my work there, and was able to learn a ton about design systems. As a prototyper I got to work with several different teams all working on different applications. It was a lot of fun to be able to jump in and out of different projects, but hard to context switch so frequently between different stacks. I really enjoyed being able to spend so much time focused on the very front end of the front end.

Over the summer I ran a workshop on CSS Grid at a handful of meetups. This was my first real experience with a full-length technical talk, and I absolutely loved it even if I am still working on my public speaking fears. I even had a chance in November to present the talk at the WordCamp conference in Portland! 

My CSS Grid talk got some good interest, and led to a few informational and actual interviews. I was even able to take a new job based off those interviews. I spent the last four months of the year updating and writing new curriculum at a local code school. I really enjoyed working with all of the students and being able to spend time studying front end topics that interested me. 

All of those good things and still I find myself about to enter 2019 with no idea about what comes next. I might be ending the year with things seeming down, but after writing all this and reminding myself of the good things I've managed to accomplish in 2018, I'm thinking that 2019 might not be so bad.
