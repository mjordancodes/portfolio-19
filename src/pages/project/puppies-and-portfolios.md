Had a little fun on the day .dev was publicly released and I ended up buying a domain for my new Puppies and Portfolios group. I had fun designing a site that was meant to challenge my CSS skills. I was recently reading about CSS Shapes, so I wanted to find a way to use them to create something kind of cool. Site is built in Gatsby and deployed with Netlify.
