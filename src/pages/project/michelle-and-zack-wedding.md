I was told to go make a wedding site. So I did, but now the wedding is over and sometimes I get bored so I am continuing to be ridiculous. I built this using Gatsby. I had a lot of fun on this project using gatsby-image to set up the photo albums quickly. I also used styled-components for styling in this project.
