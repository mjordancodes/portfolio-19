There is nothing new in this title. I have been building websites in about 3 hours at 2am since I started learning how to code. My favorite thing to do is get an idea at 2am and decide to build a new site and stay up all night doing it and then regretting the lack of sleep the next day. 

What is new, is that I might actually go back and look at this code and not cry hysterically. Normally when I do this, I go back to the basics and totally hand code the site using all static HTML and CSS and no fancy build tools or anything. Which is fine, but if I ever want to work on the project again, I always hate myself. Change my mind about the links? Want to add a new page? Nope! Have to go change it in like six different places (more if I am really lucky). 

Gatsby.js has given me a tool that allows me to do my whole middle of the night, crazy building of a project, but it allows me to do so in a way that doesn't make me hate looking at it the next day.
